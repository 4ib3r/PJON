Performance

Using only digitalWriteFast() micros() and delayMicroseconds() fast cross-architecture
communication speed can be achieved. SoftwareBitBang works in 3 different communication
modes, STANDARD, FAST and OVERDRIVE:
STANDARD: 16944Bd or 2.12kB/s cross-architecture, promiscuous clock compatible.
FAST: 25157Bd or 3.15kB/s cross-architecture, promiscuous clock compatible.
OVERDRIVE: Runs a specific architecture at its maximum limits (non cross-architecture
compatible). Every architecture has its own limits, Arduino Duemilanove for example
runs at 33898Bd or 4.23kB/s, Arduino Zero can reach 48000Bd or 6.00kB/s.

Why not interrupts?

Usage of libraries is really extensive in the Arduino environment and often the
end user is not able to go over collisions or redefinitions. Very often a library
is using hardware resources of the microcontroller as timers or interrupts, colliding
or interrupting other libraries. This happens because in general Arduino boards have
limited hardware resources. To have a universal and reliable communication medium
in this sort of environment, software emulated bit-banging, I think, is a good, stable
and reliable solution that leads to "more predictable" results than interrupt driven
systems coexisting on small microcontrollers without the original developer and the
end user knowing about it.


Known issues

1 A pull down resistor in the order of mega ohms could be necessary on the bus to
reduce interference. See https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki/Deal-with-interference

2 Consider that this is not an interrupt driven system and so all the time passed
in delay or executing something a certain amount of packets could be potentially
lost unheard, the packet manager of PJON will do its job scheduling the packet
to be sent again in future until is received or MAX_ATTEMPTS sending attempts is
reached, but a certain amount of bandwidth can be wasted. Structure intelligently
your loop cycle to avoid huge blind timeframes.

3 SoftwareBitBang strategy can have some compatibility issue with codebases that
are using interrupts in their procedure, like for example the Servo library.
Reliability or bandwidth loss can be experienced because of the cyclical
interruptions made by third party interrupt driven software to the PJON code.

    The reception tecnique is based on finding a logic 1 as long as the
    first padding bit within a certain threshold, synchronizing to its
    falling edge and checking if it is followed by a logic 0. If this
    pattern is recognised, reception starts, if not, interference,
    synchronization loss or simply absence of communication is
    detected at byte level. */
