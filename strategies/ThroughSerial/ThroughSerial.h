#include <Arduino.h>

#define THROUGH_SERIAL_MAX_BYTE_TIME        1000000
/* 1 second maximum timeframe you can have between every receive call in
   any of the connected devices without loosing synchronous acknowledment
   because delaying. */

#define THROUGH_SERIAL_FREE_TIME_BEFORE_START   500
/* 0.5 milliseconds minimum timeframe of free port before transmitting

   This timing configuration is ok for a master-slave setup, but could lead to
   collisions if used in a multi-master setup.

   If using ThroughSerial multi-master, NEVER set
   THROUGH_SERIAL_FREE_TIME_BEFORE_START < THROUGH_SERIAL_MAX_BYTE_TIME
   or a device could start transmitting while a couple is still exchanging an acknowledge

   i.e.
   #define THROUGH_SERIAL_MAX_BYTE_TIME           100000
   #define THROUGH_SERIAL_FREE_TIME_BEFORE_START  110000

   Above is shown multi-master compatible setup able to receive a synchronous
   acknowledgment with a maximum delay 100 milliseconds. Channel analysis before
   transmission is set to 110 milliseconds to avoid collisions.

   Which is the correct value for your setup depends on the maximum average time
   interval between every receive call in your system. THROUGH_SERIAL_MAX_BYTE_TIME
   should be around the same duration. So in a sketch where there is only a
   delay(10) between every receive call 10000 should be the correct value for
   THROUGH_SERIAL_MAX_BYTE_TIME.

   If your tasks timing are long and a satisfactory setup can't be reached
   consider to drop the use of the synchronous acknowledge and start using the
   asynchronous acknowledgment instead. */
