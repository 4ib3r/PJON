PJONSimpleSwitch has been contributed by Fred Larsen.

It routes packets between buses with different bus ids, and between segmented
buses as well, even for local buses with no bus ids.

A default gateway can be specified, identifying one of the attached buses to
receive packets to other target buses than any of the attached buses. It is
possible to use a PJONSimpleSwitch to handle leaf buses in a tree structure.

A segmented bus is a "virtual" bus where ranges of its devices are  located 
in separate physical buses. This allows a single local "virtual" or segmented
bus to consist of buses of different strategies. This can be used to work in
local mode, without bus ids, even if spanning different media, to reduce the
packet sizes. A switch can combine multiple media into one bus.

If you believe in this project and you appreciate our work, please, make a
donation. The PJON Foundation is entirely financed by contributions of wise
people like you and its resources are solely invested to cover the development
and maintainance costs.
