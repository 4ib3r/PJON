PJON 
====

PJON **(Padded Jittering Operative network)** is a multi-masterm, single wire, addressed and checked communication protocol for Arduino.
Every connected device has an ID (0-255) and can communicate with any other device on the network with package correctness acknowledge. Every package sent is checked by a 1 byte Cyclic Redundancy Check and is addresses to a particular device, for this reason is practically impossible to miss a package (if the receiver will not hear the message the sender will know) or to receive uncorrect data.
