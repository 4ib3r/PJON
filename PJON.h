  \+//u/+g%{osv,,\    arduino boards over one wire up to 5.29kB/s data communication speed.
    \=+&/osw+olds.\\   Contains acknowledge, collision and error detection, all done with

   - Added support for the Arduino Zero.
     Able to achieve the following speeds between two Arduino Zero
       Absolute com speed: 5215.20B/s
       Practical bandwidth: 4346.00B/s
       Packets sent: 2173.00
       Mistakes (error found with CRC) 0.00
       Fail (no answer from receiver) 0
       Busy (Channel is busy or affected by interference) 0
       Accuracy: 100.00 %

   - All comparison typecasted to preserve proper format between platforms. Comparisons
     on AVR defaults to 16 bit unless typecasted, while it defaults to 32 bits on SAMD
     This can give problems when comparison is made with timer functions such as millis(),
     micros(), delay() and delaymicroseconds().
     The function micros() and millis() both returns a unsigned long (uint32_t) on AVR and SAMD.
     Delay argument is typecasted (unsigned long) or (uint32_t) on AVR, and delaymicroseconds argument
     is typecasted (unsigned int) or (uint16_t) on AVR, while on SAMD the delay argument is typecasted
     (uint32_t), and delaymicroseconds argument is typecasted (uint32_t).

   - #endif belonging to #ifndef PJON_h moved to end of file

   - in function receive_byte, the functioncall digitalWriteFast(_input_pin,LOW) has been removed. It
     should not be necessary when the _input_pin is pulled low using a pulldown resistor. Having this
     second line only slows down.
     If the physical pulldown resistor has to be avoided, pinModeFast(_input_pin,INPUT_PULLDOWN) will
     be the correct function call to use, as the INPUT_PULLDOWN is done through pinMode and not
     digitalWriteFast.

   TO-DO
   - Reduce variable size to optimize memory footprint
